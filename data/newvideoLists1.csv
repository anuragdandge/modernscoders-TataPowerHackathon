But what about when those technologies destroy the environment? In this provocative talk, Time Magazine “Hero of the Environment” and energy expert, Michael Shellenberger explains why solar and wind farms require so much land for mining and energy production, and an alternative path to saving both the climate and the natural environment. Michael Shellenberger is a Time Magazine Hero of the Environment and President of Environmental Progress, a research and policy organization. A lifelong environmentalist, Michael changed his mind about nuclear energy and has helped save enough nuclear reactors to prevent an increase in carbon emissions equivalent to adding more than 10 million cars to the road.

Small wind turbines for home could play an important role for off grid living. A 15 kWh peak solar system that manages to supply the whole house with solar panels, produces only a fraction of renewable energy in the winter.
And this is exactly where wind turbine for home come into play for off grid users.  

this is why we are looking for the best wind turbine for home 2023 and took a closer look to new micro wind turbines for home from companies such as skywind ng , the power collective Ridgeblade and Flower turbine.

Small wind turbines for home could play an important role for off grid living. A 15 kWh peak solar system that manages to supply the whole house with solar panels, produces only a fraction of renewable energy in the winter.
And this is exactly where wind turbine for home come into play for off grid users.  

this is why we are looking for the best wind turbine for home 2023 and took a closer look to new micro wind turbines for home from companies such as skywind ng , the power collective Ridgeblade and Flower turbine.
Can these home wind turbines really replace Solar panels and guarantee using wind energy for living off the grid?

--

No matter how we make electricity, it takes up space. Coal requires mines, and plants to convert it into electricity. Nuclear power takes uranium mines, facilities to refine it, a reactor, and a place to store the spent fuel safely. Renewable energy needs wind turbines or solar panels. So how much space would it take to power the whole world? Explore the sustainability of different power sources.

Geothermal Energy is the energy obtained from the interior of the Earth. This energy is highly advantageous when compared to other energy forms as it produces 15% less greenhouse effect when compared to coal and is available 24 hours 365 days when compared to sources of energy like solar power and wind power. The availability of geothermal varies a lot and there are few places which are blessed with this form of energy. The electricity power generation plant based on geothermal energy are of dry steam type, flash type and binary type. This geothermal energy is also deployed to produce heating effect in winters and cooling effect in summers. Watch the video for more details.

Geothermal Energy is the energy obtained from the interior of the Earth. This energy is highly advantageous when compared to other energy forms as it produces 15% less greenhouse effect when compared to coal and is available 24 hours 365 days when compared to sources of energy like solar power and wind power. The availability of geothermal varies a lot and there are few places which are blessed with this form of energy. The electricity power generation plant based on geothermal energy are of dry steam type, flash type and binary type. This geothermal energy is also deployed to produce heating effect in winters and cooling effect in summers. Watch the video for more details.

Q: What is geothermal energy?
Ans: The heat energy extracted from inside the earth in the form of water and steam is known as geothermal energy or geothermal power. 
The earth's core contain hot magma in molten or semi molten form. When the underground water comes in contact with these hot rocks, they burst up into hot springs and steam. We can then convert this heat energy into other forms of energy like electrical energy, etc.

Ans: The heat energy extracted from inside the earth in the form of water and steam is known as geothermal energy or geothermal power. 
The earth's core contain hot magma in molten or semi molten form. When the underground water comes in contact with these hot rocks, they burst up into hot springs and steam. We can then convert this heat energy into other forms of energy like electrical energy, etc.

Electricity is very important to people. We use it to power our homes, cities and trains and cars. 

One of the main ways we produce electricity is with the use of a generator.  A generator is a device that converts mechanical kinetic energy into electrical energy. 

A wind turbine is a very large windmill that uses the kinetic energy in wind to spin its blades. The blades spin a generator that transforms the energy into electrical energy.

Often, particularly in very windy places, many wind turbines are grouped together to form a wind farm. Wind farms can produce enough electricity to power whole cities.

A big advantage of wind energy is that it is a clean and renewable energy source. It does not require the burning of fuels and does not produce harmful emissions in to the air.

There are some disadvantages of using wind energy. The large spinning blades on a wind turbine can kill or harm flying animal like birds and bat. They can produce loud sounds that can disturb natural environments and be annoying to people. And if damaged, wind turbines can be expensive to repair.

Geothermal Energy is the energy which is got from the earth. As people have been consuming energy since years, there may be chances of shortage of non-renewable energy sources. 

So why not to use those energy sources which are renewable? 
Scientists have also found such an amazing energy source i.e. Geothermal energy - Earth (source of this energy). 

In this video, I have shown you several advantages and disadvantages of Geothermal energy.

 #ziprecruiterpartner

It's no secret that I love rooftop solar and its popularity has been on the rise for decades. It produces power right where it is needed, lowering the strain placed on the grid. But solar power isn't perfect, and only works for 5-8 hours a day. And while commercial wind farms have also grown in popularity, smaller building-mounted wind turbines haven't historically caught on. That is, until now, and this - the Aeromine wind turbine. They believe it might just be the future of decentralized energy generation for rooftops around the world. So how does it work, and do they actually live up to the hype?  Can This Genius Wind Turbine Outperform Rooftop Solar?

Q: What are the advantages of solar energy?
Ans: There are many advantages of solar energy.
1) It is renewable source of energy. We can transfer it to other forms of energy like electrical energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, light energy, etc.
2) It is Eco-friendly source of energy which doesn't pollute our environment. It doesn't produce green house gases like Carbon Dioxide, Methane, etc.
3) It is available throughout the year.
4) It is safe to use.
5) It can be used to run vehicles.
6) Solar Panels can be installed anywhere.

Q: What are the disadvantages of solar energy?
Ans: There are some disadvantages like: 
1) Its initial cost of installation is very high.
2) Large space or area is needed for the installation of solar panels.
3) Its power production would be lesser during cloudy or rainy days.
4) It also depends on geographical location like you can't install solar panels to generate electricity in an area that receive lesser sunny days.

Natural resources can be classified as renewable or nonrenewable
A renewable resource can be replaced at the same rate in which the resource is used
Common renewable resources used to produce energy include,
Solar, like these solar panels converting solar energy into electricity. A nonrenewable resource is a resource that forms at a rate that is much slower than the rate that it is formed. Coal is an example. It takes millions of years to create coal and once it is used up it is no longer available
You can use CON to remember three popular nonrenewable resources.
This stands for 
Coal
Oil
Natural Gas

Thus combination of renewable energy sources, wind & solar ( photovoltaic ) are used for generating power. This system is designed using the solar panels and small wind turbines generators for generating electricity.
They work small capacity

The hybrid solar &  wind turbine generator uses solar panels that collect light and convert it to energy along with wind turbines that collect energy from the wind.

Thus combination of renewable energy sources, wind & solar ( photovoltaic ) are used for generating power. This system is designed using the solar panels and small wind turbines generators for generating electricity.
They work small capacity

The hybrid solar &  wind turbine generator uses solar panels that collect light and convert it to energy along with wind turbines that collect energy from the wind.

Every year, the world uses 35 billion barrels of oil. This massive scale of fossil fuel dependence pollutes the earth, and it won’t last forever. On the other hand, we have abundant sun, water and wind, which are all renewable energy sources. So why don’t we exchange our fossil fuel dependence for an existence based only on renewables? Federico Rosei and Renzo Rosei describe the challenges.

Every year, the world uses 35 billion barrels of oil. This massive scale of fossil fuel dependence pollutes the earth, and it won’t last forever. On the other hand, we have abundant sun, water and wind, which are all renewable energy sources. So why don’t we exchange our fossil fuel dependence for an existence based only on renewables? Federico Rosei and Renzo Rosei describe the challenges.

We have to do better.', 'sentiment': 'Positive', 'polarity': 0.18}]","What’s better, #solarenergy  or #windenergy. History has revealed that advances in renewable energy often follow crises: In the 1970s, oil embargos caused the cost of oil to quadruple, spurring efforts to reduce American dependence on fossil fuels and find alternative sources of power, including solar energy or wind power. The 2008-09 global financial crisis led to several governments linking part of their economic stimulus to investment in clean energy. The pandemic of 2019/2020 led to an unprecedented energy shock, and following in 2021, investment in renewable energy reached the highest levels since the Great Recession. 

But renewable energy is sustainable, now we explore which is better between solar energy and wind energy. 

The earliest recorded evidence of wind energy being used dates to around 6000 to 5000 B.C., when the sail was invented to catch the wind and propel boats. Over the years, developments in wind power allowed humans to grind grain, pump water, and eventually, around the late 1800s, generate electricity from kinetic energy. One could argue that solar energy has been used since 700 B.C., when mirrors were used to concentrate solar energy to make fire. But solar cells were not used to generate energy until 1839, when Edmond Becquerel, a young physicist working in France, first observed and noted the photovoltaic effect. It took more than a century to produce a practical solar panel after Becquerel’s discovery. Solar energy remained in the research-and-development phase for several decades. Over the next few decades, the share of U.S. electricity generation from wind grew from less than 1% in 1990 to about 8.4% in 2020. Solar energy’s share of total U.S. utility-scale electricity generation grew from 0.1% in 1990 to around 2.5% in 2020.

Solar energy can make a big difference in the prevention of global warming.

Civilization needs to strive for this goal with synergistic interdisciplinary teams.The outcome would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. There would be no loss\xa0of energy as it changes form. For example the total quantity of thermal energy in an equal pair of two thermal energy reserves with ideal insulation would remain the same regardless of how heat is distributed between the two and how often the distribution of heat between the two is changed. For example in one case one reserve could contain ice water while the other reserve\xa0contained hot water; in another case both reserves could contain tepid water. The redistribution of heat between members of pairs with the same total thermal energy would be free. Diversity, time, and energy are different atributes. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car ɓacks it up without time reversal. \n\nThe second law of thermodynamics had a distinct begining with Sir Isaac Newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flows towards the cold room beyond. \n\nVictorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, reliable, and easy to\xa0position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy using evidence from steam engine development. \n\nThese men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.\xa0 This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. \n\nThe law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference in temperature, pressure, or electricity's amperes and volts \n\nHeat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems\xa0 this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI readability. Hypothetically, diode depletion regions are\xa0 practical sites for enabling mobile electrons energized into motion by heat to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. The thermal electrical noise is hypothetically beyond the\xa0\xa0 exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion)\xa0\xa0\xa0 equlibrium thickness of the depletion region as thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. \n\nConsistantly oriented diodes in parallel hypothetically are successful electrical Maxwell's Demons or Smoluchowski's Trapdoors. The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. There would therefore be usable net rectified power from each and every diode connected together into a consistantly oriented parallel group. The group would aggregate the net power of its members. Any diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat, more efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is switched off has no energy conversion and no performance. \n\nThe power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter. \n\nModern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. \n\nZero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. \n\nEver since the supposedly universal second law of thermodynamics was formulated, education has mass produced and spread the conventional wisdom throughout society that the second law of thermodynamics is absolute. \n\nIf counterexamples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric ligts so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. \n\nCell\xa0phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Digital coin minting would be energy cheap. \n\nFrozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and pŕepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independent power. Shielding and separation would provide EMP resistance. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. \nZone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnideetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough cheap clean energy, minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. \n\nThis could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious and unified civilization.\xa0It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this. \n\nI filed for patent us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.\xa0 It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. \n\nthe patent wasn't developed partly because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attrbution for the original works of creators. Uncorrupted copies would be released on request. No further action would be taken by this institution. \n\nCommercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also, the obvious is unpatentsable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. \n\nMany financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain generally. \n\nThese devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive. \n\nAloha \n\nCharles M Brown lll \nKilauea, Kauai, Hawaii 96754\n1 808 651 📞📞📞📞"", 'sentiment': 'Positive', 'polarity': 0.11051567932440418}, {'comment_id': 'UgxtWs4Hvp8XajyooLx4AaABAg', 'author_id': 'UCOQODscY3_pB939hzwGVqSg', 'comment_text': 'Make a video on quantum generator patent...', 'sentiment': 'Neutral', 'polarity': 0}, {'comment_id': 'UgwUPhmYCl1qR462MFx4AaABAg', 'author_id': 'UCR2TafXXW1psPGV946N0R-w', 'comment_text': 'https://youtu.be/xy9nj94xvKA?si=UpcJTSp7y0nQconS\n\nThe worse part of all this is; water is hydrogen and oxygen (h2o; hydrogen is a fuel.

Solar

Solar energy is derived by capturing radiant energy from sunlight and converting it into heat, electricity, or hot water.

With the technology to harvest it, there is a limitless supply of solar energy, meaning it could render fossil fuels obsolete.

Wind

Wind farms capture the energy of wind flow by using turbines and converting it into electricity.

Wind energy is a clean energy source, which means that it doesn’t pollute the air like other forms of energy.

Wind energy doesn’t produce carbon dioxide, or release any harmful products that can cause environmental degradation or negatively affect human health like smog, acid rain, or other heat-trapping gases.

Hydroelectric

Water flows through the dam’s turbines to produce electricity, known as pumped-storage hydropower.

Hydroelectric power is very versatile and can be generated using both large scale projects, like the Hoover Dam, and small scale projects like underwater turbines and lower dams on small rivers and streams.

Geothermal

Geothermal heat is heat that is trapped beneath the earth’s crust from the formation of the Earth 4.5 billion years ago and from radioactive decay.

Geothermal energy is not as common as other types of renewable energy sources, but it has a significant potential for energy supply.

Geothermal energy is naturally replenished and therefore does not run a risk of depleting (on a human timescale).

Ocean

The ocean can produce two types of energy: thermal and mechanical.

Ocean thermal energy relies on warm water surface temperatures to generate energy through a variety of different systems.

Ocean mechanical energy uses the ebbs and flows of the tides to generate energy, which is created by the earth’s rotation and gravity from the moon.

Unlike other forms of renewable energy, wave energy is predictable and it’s easy to estimate the amount of energy that will be produced.

This type of renewable energy is also abundant, the most populated cities tend to be near oceans and harbors, making it easier to harness this energy for the local population.

Hydrogen

Hydrogen needs to be combined with other elements, such as oxygen to make water as it does not occur naturally as a gas on its own.

When hydrogen is separated from another element it can be used for both fuel and electricity.

Hydrogen can be used as a clean burning fuel, which leads to less pollution and a cleaner environment.

It can also be used for fuel cells which are similar to batteries and can be used for powering an electric motor.

Biomass

Bioenergy is a renewable energy derived from biomass.

Biomass is organic matter that comes from recently living plants and organisms.

The use of biomass in energy production creates carbon dioxide that is put into the air, but the regeneration of plants consumes the same amount of carbon dioxide, which is said to create a balanced atmosphere.

Biomass can be used in a number of different ways in our daily lives, not only for personal use, but businesses as well.

Civilization needs to strive for this goal with synergistic interdisciplinary teams.The outcome would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. There would be no loss\xa0of energy as it changes form. For example the total quantity of thermal energy in an equal pair of two thermal energy reserves with ideal insulation would remain the same regardless of how heat is distributed between the two and how often the distribution of heat between the two is changed. For example in one case one reserve could contain ice water while the other reserve\xa0contained hot water; in another case both reserves could contain tepid water. The redistribution of heat between members of pairs with the same total thermal energy would be free. Diversity, time, and energy are different atributes. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car ɓacks it up without time reversal. \n\nThe second law of thermodynamics had a distinct begining with Sir Isaac Newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flows towards the cold room beyond. \n\nVictorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, reliable, and easy to\xa0position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy using evidence from steam engine development. \n\nThese men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.\xa0 This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. \n\nThe law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference in temperature, pressure, or electricity's amperes and volts \n\nHeat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems\xa0 this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI readability. Hypothetically, diode depletion regions are\xa0 practical sites for enabling mobile electrons energized into motion by heat to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. The thermal electrical noise is hypothetically beyond the\xa0\xa0 exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion)\xa0\xa0\xa0 equlibrium thickness of the depletion region as thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. \n\nConsistantly oriented diodes in parallel hypothetically are successful electrical Maxwell's Demons or Smoluchowski's Trapdoors. The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. There would therefore be usable net rectified power from each and every diode connected together into a consistantly oriented parallel group. The group would aggregate the net power of its members. Any diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat, more efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is switched off has no energy conversion and no performance. \n\nThe power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter. \n\nModern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. \n\nZero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. \n\nEver since the supposedly universal second law of thermodynamics was formulated, education has mass produced and spread the conventional wisdom throughout society that the second law of thermodynamics is absolute. \n\nIf counterexamples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric ligts so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. \n\nCell\xa0phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Digital coin minting would be energy cheap. \n\nFrozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and pŕepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independent power. Shielding and separation would provide EMP resistance. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. \nZone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnideetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough cheap clean energy, minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. \n\nThis could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious and unified civilization.\xa0It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this. \n\nI filed for patent us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.\xa0 It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. \n\nthe patent wasn't developed partly because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attrbution for the original works of creators. Uncorrupted copies would be released on request. No further action would be taken by this institution. \n\nCommercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also, the obvious is unpatentsable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. \n\nMany financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain generally. \n\nThese devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive. \n\nAloha \n\nCharles M Brown lll \nKilauea, Kauai, Hawaii 96754\n1 808 651 📞📞📞📞"", 'sentiment': 'Positive', 'polarity': 0.11051567932440418}, {'comment_id': 'UgxtWs4Hvp8XajyooLx4AaABAg', 'author_id': 'UCOQODscY3_pB939hzwGVqSg', 'comment_text': 'Make a video on quantum generator patent...', 'sentiment': 'Neutral', 'polarity': 0}, {'comment_id': 'UgwUPhmYCl1qR462MFx4AaABAg', 'author_id': 'UCR2TafXXW1psPGV946N0R-w', 'comment_text': 'https://youtu.be/xy9nj94xvKA?si=UpcJTSp7y0nQconS\n\nThe worse part of all this is; water is hydrogen and oxygen (h2o; hydrogen is a fuel.

Solar

Solar energy is derived by capturing radiant energy from sunlight and converting it into heat, electricity, or hot water.

With the technology to harvest it, there is a limitless supply of solar energy, meaning it could render fossil fuels obsolete.

Wind

Wind farms capture the energy of wind flow by using turbines and converting it into electricity.

Wind energy is a clean energy source, which means that it doesn’t pollute the air like other forms of energy.

Wind energy doesn’t produce carbon dioxide, or release any harmful products that can cause environmental degradation or negatively affect human health like smog, acid rain, or other heat-trapping gases.

Hydroelectric

Water flows through the dam’s turbines to produce electricity, known as pumped-storage hydropower.

Hydroelectric power is very versatile and can be generated using both large scale projects, like the Hoover Dam, and small scale projects like underwater turbines and lower dams on small rivers and streams.

Geothermal

Geothermal heat is heat that is trapped beneath the earth’s crust from the formation of the Earth 4.5 billion years ago and from radioactive decay.

Geothermal energy is not as common as other types of renewable energy sources, but it has a significant potential for energy supply.

Geothermal energy is naturally replenished and therefore does not run a risk of depleting (on a human timescale).

Ocean

The ocean can produce two types of energy: thermal and mechanical.

Ocean thermal energy relies on warm water surface temperatures to generate energy through a variety of different systems.

Ocean mechanical energy uses the ebbs and flows of the tides to generate energy, which is created by the earth’s rotation and gravity from the moon.

Unlike other forms of renewable energy, wave energy is predictable and it’s easy to estimate the amount of energy that will be produced.

This type of renewable energy is also abundant, the most populated cities tend to be near oceans and harbors, making it easier to harness this energy for the local population.

Hydrogen

Hydrogen needs to be combined with other elements, such as oxygen to make water as it does not occur naturally as a gas on its own.

When hydrogen is separated from another element it can be used for both fuel and electricity.

Hydrogen can be used as a clean burning fuel, which leads to less pollution and a cleaner environment.

It can also be used for fuel cells which are similar to batteries and can be used for powering an electric motor.

Biomass

Bioenergy is a renewable energy derived from biomass.

Biomass is organic matter that comes from recently living plants and organisms.

The use of biomass in energy production creates carbon dioxide that is put into the air, but the regeneration of plants consumes the same amount of carbon dioxide, which is said to create a balanced atmosphere.

Biomass can be used in a number of different ways in our daily lives, not only for personal use, but businesses as well.

Geothermal energy is a renewable and sustainable form of energy that comes from the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. It is harnessed for various applications, including electricity generation and direct heating. Here are some key points about geothermal energy:

Heat Source: The Earth's interior heat is a result of the planet's formation and the radioactive decay of elements. This heat flows from the core towards the surface and creates geothermal reservoirs of hot water and steam.

Electricity Generation: Geothermal power plants use the heat from these reservoirs to produce electricity. There are several types of geothermal power plants:

Dry Steam Power Plants: They use steam from underground reservoirs to directly drive turbines, which generate electricity.
Flash Steam Power Plants: High-pressure hot water from the reservoir is released into a lower-pressure environment, causing it to ""flash"" into steam that drives turbines.
Binary Cycle Power Plants: Geothermal fluid at a lower temperature heats a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point. The secondary fluid vaporizes and drives turbines.
Direct Use Applications: Geothermal energy is also used directly for heating purposes. Hot water or steam from geothermal reservoirs is pumped to the surface and used for space heating, district heating systems, greenhouse heating, and industrial processes.

Geothermal Heat Pumps: These systems take advantage of the relatively constant temperature just a few feet below the Earth's surface to provide heating, cooling, and hot water for buildings. They are highly efficient and can significantly reduce energy consumption.

Environmental Benefits: Geothermal energy is considered environmentally friendly because it produces very low greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels. It also has a smaller land footprint compared to many other energy sources.

Geothermal Potential: The availability of geothermal energy depends on geological conditions. Regions located near tectonic plate boundaries, known as ""geothermal hotspots,"" have the greatest potential for geothermal energy production. However, some technologies like geothermal heat pumps can be used in a wider range of locations.

Challenges: While geothermal energy has many benefits, challenges include the need for suitable geothermal resources, drilling and exploration costs, and potential subsurface environmental impacts.

Global Distribution: Geothermal energy resources are found all around the world, with significant utilization in countries like Iceland, the United States, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Italy.

Geothermal energy is a valuable resource for achieving a more sustainable energy mix and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Continued research and development in geothermal technology and exploration can help unlock its full potential as a clean and reliable energy source.

While some renewable energy sources — like the sun, the wind, and water — can easily be seen and/or felt, geothermal (or simply “thermal”) energy comes from a more enigmatic source: the heat far below the Earth’s crust. For more than 100 years, steam from below the Earth’s surface has been used to generate power. From electricity generated through geothermal power plants to district energy systems that heat and cool buildings using an underground network of pipes, this alternative energy source has big potential. Now that’s deep! Check out this video to learn more about how geothermal energy works.

Renewable Energy 101 

If you've ever observed an erupting volcano or the geysers at Yellowstone National Park, you've seen geothermal energy in action. 

The Earth's crust is made of rocks and water. Deep below that is a layer of hot, molten rock called “magma,” which is even hotter than the sun's surface. The heat just over six miles below the surface contains 50,000 times more energy than all the oil and natural gas resources in the world. 

Releasing a small amount of that heat in the right way can create electricity. A well drilled a couple of miles deep can capture the rising hot water and steam. That steam spins a turbine and a generator produces electricity. 

Geothermal is one of the least explored sources of renewable energy in the U.S., and most of us probably don't spend much time thinking about it. But since it's a pollution-free renewable source of energy that's consistently reliable — at least it has been for the past 4.5 billion years — maybe we should! 

About Green Mountain Energy: As the nation’s longest-serving renewable energy retailer, we’ve been on a mission to change the way power is made since 1997. By choosing our 100% clean, renewable wind and solar energy plans for their homes and businesses, Green Mountain customers have avoided more than 81 billion pounds of CO2 emissions to date — that’s like taking 8.6 million cars off the road for an entire year! But, we’re more than just an energy company. We’re helping our customers make a positive environmental impact, support a cleaner grid and green their carbon footprints with sustainable living solutions, renewable energy plans and the purchase of carbon offsets. And, our charitable program, Green Mountain Energy Sun Club®, has donated more than $10 million in grants to nonprofits for sustainability projects focused on renewable energy, energy efficiency, resource conservation and environmental stewardship.

Geothermal energy is a renewable and sustainable form of energy that comes from the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. It is harnessed for various applications, including electricity generation and direct heating. Here are some key points about geothermal energy:

Heat Source: The Earth's interior heat is a result of the planet's formation and the radioactive decay of elements. This heat flows from the core towards the surface and creates geothermal reservoirs of hot water and steam.

Electricity Generation: Geothermal power plants use the heat from these reservoirs to produce electricity. There are several types of geothermal power plants:

Dry Steam Power Plants: They use steam from underground reservoirs to directly drive turbines, which generate electricity.
Flash Steam Power Plants: High-pressure hot water from the reservoir is released into a lower-pressure environment, causing it to ""flash"" into steam that drives turbines.
Binary Cycle Power Plants: Geothermal fluid at a lower temperature heats a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point. The secondary fluid vaporizes and drives turbines.
Direct Use Applications: Geothermal energy is also used directly for heating purposes. Hot water or steam from geothermal reservoirs is pumped to the surface and used for space heating, district heating systems, greenhouse heating, and industrial processes.

Geothermal Heat Pumps: These systems take advantage of the relatively constant temperature just a few feet below the Earth's surface to provide heating, cooling, and hot water for buildings. They are highly efficient and can significantly reduce energy consumption.

Environmental Benefits: Geothermal energy is considered environmentally friendly because it produces very low greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels. It also has a smaller land footprint compared to many other energy sources.

Geothermal Potential: The availability of geothermal energy depends on geological conditions. Regions located near tectonic plate boundaries, known as ""geothermal hotspots,"" have the greatest potential for geothermal energy production. However, some technologies like geothermal heat pumps can be used in a wider range of locations.

Challenges: While geothermal energy has many benefits, challenges include the need for suitable geothermal resources, drilling and exploration costs, and potential subsurface environmental impacts.

Global Distribution: Geothermal energy resources are found all around the world, with significant utilization in countries like Iceland, the United States, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Italy.

Geothermal energy is a valuable resource for achieving a more sustainable energy mix and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Continued research and development in geothermal technology and exploration can help unlock its full potential as a clean and reliable energy source.
